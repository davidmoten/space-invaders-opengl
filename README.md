space-invaders-opengl
=====================

Copied from http://www.lwjgl.org/wiki/index.php?title=Space_Invaders_Example_Game. These classes were all listed on a website individually with no easy way to play with the project in an IDE so I made this project.

Getting started
----------------------

You can run it as a java application or an applet.

To run as an application from the command line:

    git clone https://github.com/davidmoten/space-invaders-opengl.git
    cd space-invaders-opengl
    mvn test exec:java
    
Or in Eclipse as an applet:

Import the project into eclipse using File - Import - Maven - Existing projects

Then in Package Explorer select the <code>space-invaders-opengl</code> project, click right mouse button Run As - Applet.
